        <h1>Parametric Functions</h1>
        <p>We know that for a relation to be a function, it must pass the vertical line test—showing that each \(x\)-value is paired with only one \(y\)-value.</p>
        <p>But this limitation excludes any curves with self-intersections or even some basic curves such as circles.</p>
        <p>Parametrization is an alternative method for describing curves that is not subject to the severe restriction of the vertical line test.</p>
        <p>Parametric functions are used to describe motion in a plane (or even in space) and is an underlying concept for multivariable calculus.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Normally, when we think of curves, we think of functions where the value of the \(y\)-coordinate is determined by the value of the \(x\)-value.</p>
        <p>With parametric functions, both the \(x\)- and \(y\)-coordinates are determined by the value of the parameter—most often \(t\).</p>
        
        <h2>Eliminating the Parameter</h2>
        <p>Eliminating the parameter is a method of switching back to rectangular coordinates.</p>
        <p>Given a parametric equation $$\begin{cases}x=f(t) \\ y=g(t)\end{cases}$$ we can eliminate the parameter in three ways.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Solve each equation for the parameter \(t\), then set the equations equal to one another.</li>
            <li>Solve one equation for the parameter \(t\), then plug that value into the second equation.</li>
            <li>Solve each equation for part of a trigonometric identity, then plug both values into the identity.</li>
        </ol>
