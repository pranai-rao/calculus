        <h1>Average Value</h1>
        <p>In scientific work, numeric information is often summarized by an <span class="italic">average value</span> or <span class="italic">mean value</span> of the observed data.</p>
        <p>There are various kinds of averages, but the most common is the <span class="bi">arithmetic mean</span> or the <span class="bi">arithmetic average</span>.</p>
        <p>This is the one that is most likely to come to mind when "average" is mentioned: it is found by adding the data and dviding by the number of data points.</p>
        <p>But what happens when we have a continuous function instead of a finite set of discrete values?</p>

        <h2>Mean Value Theorem Revisited</h2>
        <p>If \(f\) is continuous on a closed interval \([a,b]\), then there is at least one point \(x^*\) in \([a,b]\) such that $$\int_a^bf(x)dx=f(x^*)(b-a)$$</p>
        <p>Previously, we looked at the <a href="MVT.html">MVT</a> as the basis for finding the <a href="FTC2.html">FTC Part 2</a>, but now we will look at it as the basis for finding the average value of a continuous function.</p>
        <p>If we have an interval, there is some value \(x^*\) in the interval where \(f(x^*)(b-a)\) that is equal to the integral.</p>
        <p>This quantity, \(f(x^*)\), is our candidate to be the average value.</p>
        <p>The proof of this is very similar to how we find an integral, but we don't need to know the proof. We just need to know the result.</p>

        <h2>Average Value</h2>
        <p>If \(f\) is continuous on a closed interval \([a,b]\), then the <span class="bi">average value</span> (or <span class="bi">mean value</span>) of \(f\) on \([a,b]\) is defined to be $$f_{\mathrm{avg}}=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)dx$$</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <ol class="practice">
            <li>Find the average value of the function \(f(x)=\sqrt{x}\) over the interval \([1,4]\).</li>
            <p>\(\begin{align}f_{\mathrm{avg}} &= \frac{1}{4-1}\int_1^4\sqrt{x}dx \\ &= \frac{1}{3}\bigg{[}\frac{2}{3}x^\frac{3}{2}\bigg{\vert}_1^4\bigg{]} \\ &= \frac{14}{9}\end{align}\)</p>

            <li>Water is run at a constant rate of 1 ft&#179;/min to fill a cylindrical tank of radius 3 ft and height 5 ft. Assuming the tank is initially empty, find the average weight of the water in the tank over the time period required to fill it. The weight density of water is 62.4 lb/ft&#179;.</li>
            <p>\(\begin{align} V &= \pi r^2h \\ &= \pi(3)^25 \\ &= 45\pi\end{align}\)</p>
            <p>\(\begin{align} \text{Time to fill} &= \frac{\mathrm{volume}}{\mathrm{rate}} \\ &= \frac{45\pi\text{ ft}^3}{1\text{ ft}^3\text{/min}} \\ &= 45\pi \text{ min}\end{align}\)</p>
            <p>Thus, the interval is \([0,45\pi]\).</p>
            <p>\(\begin{align}W &= \text{weight of the water in the tank} \\ &= \text{(density)(rate)(time)} \\ &= 62.4(1)t\end{align}\)</p>
            <p>\(W(t)=62.4t\)</p>
            <p>\(\begin{align}W_{\mathrm{avg}}&=\frac{1}{45\pi-0}\int_0^{45\pi}62.4tdt \\ &= 1404\pi \\ &= 4410.796 \text{ lb}\end{align}\)</p>
