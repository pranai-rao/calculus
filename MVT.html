        <h1>Mean Value Theorem</h1>
        <h2>Mean Value Theorem for Derivatives</h2>
        <p>Let \(f\) be continuous on the closed interval \([a,b]\) and differentiable on the open interval \((a,b)\). Then there is at least one point \(c\) in \((a,b)\) such that $$f'(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$</p>
        <h3>Geometrically</h3>
        <img src="img/MVT-ex1.png" width="625">
        <p>Between any two points A (\(a, f(a))\) and B (\(b, f(b))\) on the graph of a differentiable function \(f\), there is at least one place where the tangent line to the graph is parallel to the secant line joining A and B.</p>
        <p>While this tells us that the point \(c\) exists, it does not tell us how to find it.</p>

        <h2>Extending the MVT to the Area Problem</h2>
        <p>Let \(f\) be a continuous nonnegative function on \([a,b]\), and let \(m\) and \(M\) be the minimum and maximum values of \(f(x)\) on this interval. Consider the rectangles of heights \(m\) and \(M\) on the interval \([a,b]\).</p>
        <img src="img/MVT-ex2.png" height="200">
        <p>It is clear from this picture that the area \(A=\int_a^bf(x)dx\) under \(y=f(x)\) is at least as large as the area of the rectangle of height \(m\) and no larger than the area of the rectangle of height \(M\).</p>
        <p>Small rectangle: \(A=m(b-a)\)</p>
        <p>Large rectangle: \(A=M(b-a)\)</p>
        <p>\(m(b-a)\leq\int_a^bf(x)dx\leq M(b-a)\)</p>
        <p>If the integral is between \(m\) and \(M\), then there must be some \(x^*\) such that the height \(f(x^*)(b-a)\) is exactly equal to the area under the curve $$\int_a^bf(x)dx=f(x^*)(b-a)$$</p>

        <h2>Mean Value Theorem for Integrals</h2>
        <p>If \(f\) is continuous on \([a,b]\) then there is at least one point \(x^*\) in \([a,b]\) such that \(\int_a^bf(x)dx=f(x^*)(b-a)\). This is an existence theorem.</p>

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>Find all values of \(x^*\) in the stated interval that are generated by the MVT for \(f(x)=3x^2-2x\) on the closed interval \([1,4]\).</p>
        <p>$$\begin{align}\int_a^bf(x)dx &= f(x^*)(b-a) \\ 
            \int_1^4(3x^2-2x)dx &= [3(x^*)^2-2(x^*)](4-1) \\ 
            x^3-x^2\bigg{\vert}_1^4 &= 9(x^*)^2-6(x^*) \\ 
            (4^3-4^2)-(1^3-1^2) &= 9(x^*)^2-6(x^*) \\ 
            16 &= 3(x^*)-2x^* \\ 
            3(x^*)-2x^*-16 &= 0 \\ 
            (3x^*-8)(x^*+2) &= 0\end{align}$$
            $$x^*=\frac{8}{3}, x^*=-2$$
            $$x^*=\frac{8}{3}$$
        </p>
        <p>Note: The value \(x^*=-2\) can be ruled out as it is not in the closed interval \([1,4]\).</p>

        <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
        <p>This is the theorem used to show that continuous functions have antiderivatives, and that is the underlying principle being the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 2 (FTC-2).</p>
